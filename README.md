# C-Sharp-College-Module-Organiser
A C# windows application for storing and organising a studentâ€™s college modules/ assignments. 
This program allows a student to choose a module from a list which are sorted in numerical order then add it to their organiser. The program will then display the assignments 
associated with each chosen module and sort them into due date order and let the user know if any are overdue. The user can also add notes with each module and assignment and save those notes to view later.
